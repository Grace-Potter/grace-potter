## Tech Stack
### Front End:
React and Redux
### Back End:
Express, Seuqelize, and PostgreSQL



## Features
### Guest User Experience
Users who choose not to sign in can still get the full experience by browsing, adding to cart, and having a persistent checkout page regardless of the fact that they haven't created an account.

### Order Verification Email
Upon order submission, users are sent an email from a custom Grace Potter address confirming that their order has been received, along with their order confirmation number.

### Secure, Hash-and-Salt Protected Passwords
For users who sign up to the website, they can rest assured that their sensitive information (i.e. passwords) are both hashed and salted in order to maximize privacy. 

### Google OAuth
For those who would rather sign in through their Google accounts, that option is available as well with fully-functioning Google OAuth capabilities

### Route Protection
Back-end routes are built to withstand unwanted interference from external users who lack authentication, authorization, or both.
